          An ever growing collection featuring some of the best scenes in
          horror.

          “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of the
          most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares, others
          may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that aren't
          necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror.

          Best Horror Scenes is a love letter to the Horror film genre by
          Brandon Durham. Most film clips contain major spoilers, and it is
          recommended you don’t watch the clip if you plan on seeing the film.

              This film flew under the radar for me until a few years ago. I’d
              heard about it several times and knew it was considered a classic,
              but, to be completely transparent, I sometimes have a tough time
              convincing myself to watch older films for fear that they just
              won’t hold up well. Particularly films in the Horror genre. While
              Tourist Trap is undeniably a product of its time, it’s an
              important film in the annals of Horror and is often legitimately
              creepy. I mean, murderous mannequins? EEK! Once, when I asked,
              “Why do people put concrete deer in their front yard? Is it to
              ward off other deer?” my friend Toto replied, “Would you go into a
              house that had a bunch of mannequins in the front yard?” No. I
              most definitely would not.
